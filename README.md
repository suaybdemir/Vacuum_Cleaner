# Vacuum Cleaner Simulation

## Project Description

This project implements a simple grid-based simulation where an item (cleaner) moves around a grid, collects garbage, and avoids obstacles. The cleaner can move in four directions and returns to the origin after completing its movement.

## Features

- Random placement of garbage and obstacles on a grid.
- The cleaner moves according to specified axes.
- The simulation visually represents the cleaner's movement on the grid.
- Console output provides feedback on the cleaner's actions, including when it encounters obstacles.

## Requirements

- C++11 or higher
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Standard libraries: `<iostream>`, `<cstdint>`, `<thread>`, `<chrono>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the source code):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
